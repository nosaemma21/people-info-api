# A simple API used for getting random people details

This api just has one endpoint to get the details of people which include name, age, zipcodes and other stuff, in other words, it is minimal completely 👍👍

## Usage

It's a containerized application and unhosted so you know the drill😗😗
No copyright, feel free to use and even host as yours, and leave a star 💓

## Endpoint

http://localhost:3000/api/people

```
docker run -p 3000:3000 --name customname nosaemma21/peopledetailsapi
```

## Note

I repeat once again it is not hosted 📢📢📢
